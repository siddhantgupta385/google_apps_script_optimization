- Check that all functions referenced in `onOpen()` exist in your code
- Make sure you saved your code after pasting

### API Key Issues:
- If you see "Error fetching odds" in the logs, the API key might be invalid
- The provided API keys might have usage limits or expiration dates
- Consider getting your own API keys if necessary

### Sheet Structure Issues:
- If functions fail, verify the expected sheets exist
- Check column names in the sheets match what the code expects

## Advanced Testing
